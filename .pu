  Runners are modules that do certain work, i.e. install software, or remove it.
  They are located in two folders: ./helpers and ./installers and are divided
  logically into 'Helpers' and 'Installers' correspondingly. NOTE: each
  runner is a bash script with a bash function matching scripts name.

  [1;32mInstallers[0m  are the modules that install something new and
              are to be included in the list of a complete install. They are
              ordered. For example 'install_ruby' installs ruby and dependencies.
              To run ALL installers, use the -a flag.

  [1;32mHelpers[0m     are similar to installers, except they are not run as
              part of the full install. They must be invoked by name directly.
              Because of that, helpers tend to be more diverse in nature: some
              uninstall things, fix things, and so on.

  But collectively, helpers and installers are just 'runners' and are the 'units'
  of pullulant's magical universe...

  -R          full install: executes each runner from the './installers' dir

  -r 'runner runner ...'
              run specific installer(s) and/or helper(s) in the provided order

  -s 'runner runner ...'
              skip a specific installer otherwise included with either -R or -r

  -l          list available installers and helpers

  -V postgresql-version
              If provided, this version is installed, otherwise the latest

   -b ruby-version Override ruby version to install specified in packages

  -S          [S]proutwrap is disabled during the full install
  -B          [B]rew-upgrade is disabled during the full install
  -P          No backu[P] for rsync of bash and zsh files (default is to backup)
  -k          When installing ruby's NOKOGIRI library, do NOT set
              NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES to 1 when -k is set
  -m          When installing iTerm themes, prefer the small selection of

  [1;32mFeatures[0m    are a set of brew packages, bash-it plug-ins, completions
              and aliases, defined a particular theme. For example, ruby feature
              enables bash aliases and completions releated to all ruby
              development tools. It also adds a ruby-specific set of brew
              formulas and casks — such as RubyMine IDE, etc.

  -f 'feature feature ....'
              Merge packages from a provided set of features.

[4;33mError Handing:                                                                  [0m

              Default error handling is pessimistic: installer stops upon any
              error code returned from a single 'run' statement.
              You can control error handling at two levels:

  -i          [i]gnore errors and continue to the next 'run' statement.

  -I          Stops running the current installer that produced an error, skips
              the rest of it, and continues to the next installer. For example,
              in this mode, if one homebrew package fails to install, the rest
              of homebrew installer will be skipped, and the next installer in
              the run list will begin.

  -o          f[o]rce – applies to some installers, ie. brew (--force) and
              zsh (overwrites current shell to ZSH). Also some rsync
              installers may behave differently with -f.

              -C -F -L flags allow picking specific subset of the install.
              The flags can mix. Adding all three is the same as adding none.

  -L          Only [L]ink packages configured for brew linking
  -C          Only [C]asks are installed from a configured list
  -U          Only form[U]las are installed from a configured list

              These apply to all brew commands:
  -y          [R]einstall each formulae during brew install
  -K          Relin[K] all brew formulas/casks during install

  -e expr     evaluate expression in the context of pullulant post loading.
              This can be useful if you are developing / debugging the code.

  For example, it allows you to evaluate any function that 'pu' loads into the
  bash space. Some examples – here we are evaluating library function
  pu-installers() which returns an array of all installers found in the folder.

              [1;32mpu -e pu-installers[0m

  Next, we can print every pu- related function loaded into memory:
