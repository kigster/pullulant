# Sensible Bash - An attempt at saner Bash defaults
# Maintainer: mrzool <http://mrzool.cc>
# Repository: https://github.com/mrzool/bash-sensible
# Version: 0.2

## GENERAL OPTIONS ##

# Prevent file overwrite on stdout redirection
# Use `>|` to force redirection to an existing file
#set -o noclobber

# Update window size after every command
shopt -s checkwinsize

# Allows space to complete and expand !$ eg:
# $ ls Projects
# $ cd !$<space> # completes to `cd Projects`
bind Space:magic-space

## SMARTER TAB-COMPLETION (Readline bindings) ##

# Perform file completion in a case insensitive fashion
bind "set completion-ignore-case on"

# Treat hyphens and underscores as equivalent
bind "set completion-map-case on"

# Display matches for ambiguous patterns at first tab press
bind "set show-all-if-ambiguous on"

## SANE HISTORY DEFAULTS ##

# Append to the history file, don't overwrite it
shopt -s histappend

# Save multi-line commands as one command
shopt -s cmdhist

# Record each line as it gets issued
#PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'

# Huge history. Doesn't appear to slow things down, so why not?
HISTSIZE=500000
HISTFILESIZE=100000

# Avoid duplicate entries
HISTCONTROL="erasedups:ignoreboth"

# Don't record some commands
export HISTIGNORE="&:[ ]*:exit:ls:bg:fg:history:clear"

# Useful timestamp format
HISTTIMEFORMAT='%F %T '

# Enable incremental history search with up/down arrows (also Readline goodness)
# Learn more about this here: http://codeinthehole.com/writing/the-most-important-command-line-tip-incremental-history-searching-with-inputrc/
bind '"\e[A": history-search-backward'
bind '"\e[B": history-search-forward'
bind '"\e[C": forward-char'
bind '"\e[D": backward-char'

## BETTER DIRECTORY NAVIGATION ##

# Prepend cd to directory names automatically
shopt -s autocd 2> /dev/null
# Correct spelling errors during tab-completion
shopt -s dirspell 2> /dev/null
# Correct spelling errors in arguments supplied to cd
shopt -s cdspell 2> /dev/null

# This defines where cd looks for targets
# Add the directories you want to have fast access to, separated by colon
# Ex: CDPATH=".:~:~/projects" will look for targets in the current working directory, in home and in the ~/projects folder
export CDPATH=".:~:~/workspace:~/arduino:~/workspace/kigster"

# This allows you to bookmark your favorite places across the file system
# Define a variable containing a path and you will be able to cd into it regardless of the directory you're in
shopt -s cdable_vars

# Examples:
export ws="$HOME/workspace"
export docs="$HOME/Documents"
export dropbox="$HOME/Dropbox"
