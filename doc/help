   postgres-reinstall, postgres-start, postgres-stop, postgres-wipe, sudo-disable,    
   sudo-enable    
                                                                                    
                                                                                    

Usage:
  pu -a          [features] [-S] [-B] [-Z] [-iI] [fmt]
  pu [runners]   [features] [-S] [-B]            [fmt]
  pu -r homebrew [features] [-L|-F|-C] [-R] [-f] [-K] [fmt]

Or for Help:
  pu [-l|-T|-h|-H|-x]

Where:
  [runners]   is one or more installers or helpers passed via '-r' flag, like
              so: ' ... -r install_bash -r bash_it -r osx ...'
              Print the available list by running 'pu -l'

  [fmt]       is combination of flags controlling the output you see on the
              screen: [-n] [-q|-v] [-p]

  [features]  is a list of enabled features (see below).

Full Run (All installers):
  -a          run [a]ll installers in their order (from the 'installers' dir)
    -S        [S]proutwrap is disabled during the install
    -B        [B]rew-upgrade is disabled
    -P        No backu[P] for rsync of bash and zsh files (default is to backup)

Error Handing:
              Default error handling is pessimistic: installer stops upon any
              error code returned from a single 'run' statement.

              You can control error handling at two levels:

  -i          [i]gnore errors and continue to the next 'run' statement.

  -I          Stops running the current installer that produced an error, skips
              the rest of it, and continues to the next installer. For example,
              in this mode, if one homebrew package fails to install, the rest
              of homebrew installer will be skipped, and the next installer in
              the run list will begin.

Features:
  -t feature1 -t feature2 ...

              List of features to run in addition to the 'default'. Features add
              a number of brew packages, nodejs modules, bash-it plugins and
              aliases grouped together for a specific purpose. For example, 'ruby'
              feature installs RubyMine IDE, and other ruby-specific tools, while
              'python' feature installs PyCharm IDE and python-specific tools.

              Take a look at the 'features' folder for more information. Note
              that the 'default' feature always runs, and contains the definition
              of the variables other features can extend.

              Available Features: aws default nodejs python ruby web

  -T          List available fea[T]ures in the 'features' folder.

Partial run (multiple runners can be listed in quotes or multiple -r flags):
  -r runner   run only a specified [r]unner (helper or installer)
              eg: pu -r 'zsh osx' -r home

  -f          [F]orce  applies to some installers, ie. brew (--force) and
              zsh (overwrites current)

Homebrew:
              -C -F -L flags allow picking specific subset of the install.
              The flags can mix. Adding all three is the same as adding none.

  -L          Only [L]ink packages configured for brew linking
  -C          Only [C]asks are installed from a configured list
  -F          Only [F]ormulas are installed from a configured list

              These apply to all brew commands:
  -R          [R]einstall each formulae during brew install
  -K          Relin[K] all brew formulas/casks during install

Zsh
  -Z          Change the default shell to ZSH and install 'oh-my-zsh'

Output control:
  -p          su[p]press pretty section headers for more compact output
  -q          [q]uiet mode: stop printing commands before and after run.
  -v          [v]erbose - show each command's output, and add -v to some
  -n          dry-ru[n] print commands, but don't actually run them.

Help & Info:
  -l          [l]ist available runners  helpers and installers
  -h          this [h]elp message
  -H          this help message, and explanation of helpers and installers
  -x          same as -H but in plain ascii (also saves into doc/help)

Examples:
    # install everything with the default (small) set of packages:
    pu -a

    # install everything with additional packages and plugins enabled
    # suitable for ruby,python,node development, as well as install
    # services used in web development such as nginx, haproxy, etc, as well
    # as install the packages and plugins for managing AWS infrastructure.
    pu -a -t ruby -t python -t nodejs -t web -t aws

    # use a helper (not an installer) to wipe clean and reinstall postgresql
    # from brew, create a new UTF8 database, and ensure it's running after.
    pu -r reinstall-postgres      # run just reinstall-postgres

    # wipe and reinstall homebrew, with additional ruby packages included
    pu -r brew-wipe   -r homebrew -t ruby

    # repair and install all brew packages, with additional python packages
    pu -r brew-repair -r homebrew -t python

    # when installing brew packages, skip casks or linking, and only install
    # formulas. Use verbose output.
    pu -r homebrew -F -pv

    # install everything, minus homebrew and sprout-wrap, including
    # features listed. Note that brew-specific portion of features
    # is ignored in this case.
    pu -aSB -t ruby -t python -t nodejs -t web -t aws

  Runner:
      Most common usage is with the -a  flag, that runs all installers.
      Installers are bash modules located in the ./installers folder. Each
      installer has a bash function that matches the name of the file.

      The -r flag can be supplied more than once, or once but with multiple
      arguments in quotes, eg -r 'runner1 runner2' or -r runner1
      -r runner2. Presence of this flag indicates that only specified
      runnings will run.

  Helpers
      Helpers are similar to installers, but they are not ordered, and are
      not included in the default install. They are meant to be used ad-hoc.

      You can add new installers and helpers by adding new files in the
      corresponding folders with bash functions matching the name.

      For example, to enable password-less sudo, use 'sudo-enable' helper:

      pu -r sudo-enable
