# Pullulant Development Environment on Mac OS-X

This document describes a set of quick steps to run a fully automated setup of the development
environment needed to build ruby applications on Mac OS-X.

## Pre-Install â€“ OS-X Preparation

  1. Run `xcode-select --install` to make sure you have dev tools
  2. Run OS-X Updates if any, and reboot if requested.
  3. Go to _System Preferences / Security & Privacy / General_, unlock the panel and choose the radio button "Allow apps downloaded from <Anywhere>". This is required for running `phantomjs` binary that's downloaded later.
  4. Go to _System Preferences / Sharing_, unlock the panel and set the hostname of your system, if it's currently set to a default.

### About your OS-X user

Note: shared resources used by the Homebrew, such as files under `/usr/local`, will change ownership
to the user running this installer, with full `xwr` permissions. This is so that the effects of any previously run `sudo brew` nuisance is neutralized.

Typically your group will be `staff`.  Whatever group you are, that group is applied to the key const_owned_folder_list (`/usr/local` and `/var/chef`), with permissions also reset to `xwr`. The idea is that this move should permit multiple co-existing users to share `/usr/local` and `/var/chef` at the same time.  

Note that the current OS-X user must be configured as "Admin" on the Mac, and upon entering their password after the first request for `sudo`, the user will be modified to allow password-less `sudo` access for the duration of the script.

At the very end, installer cleans this up, or you can run `pullulant -r reset-sudo`


## Install

  1. If you don't already have SSH keys setup on this machine, now is the time: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "${USER}@${HOSTNAME}"; cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy`
  2. Add the new SSH key to the Github settings page: https://github.com/settings/ssh
  3. Run the following installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL 'http://sw.im/pullulant.sh' | /usr/bin/env bash
```

Alternatively:

```bash
export ws="~/workspace"     # your workspace directory
[[ -d ${ws} ]] || mkdir -p ${ws}
[[ -d "${ws}/pullulant" ]] || cd ${ws} && git clone "git@github.com:kigster/pullulant.git"
cd pullulant && git pull && ./pullulant -a
```

## After a Successful Install

 * Reboot (required after the first successful install!)
 * Open System Preferences, Security & Privacy, choose Privacy tab and unlock the lock at the bottom. After that choose Accessibility and then check "ShiftIt" application.
